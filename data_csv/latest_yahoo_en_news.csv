"China strongly opposes the release of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Harassing phone calls to Japan continued even after a week had passed since the release. When Bankisha visited a restaurant, she found an unexpected message left on its answering machine. What are the true intentions of the Chinese people? On the 2nd, Truth Report Bankisha Bankisha reported on a ramen shop in Kasukabe City, Saitama. The owner of the ramen shop's phone rings during the day and calls even in the middle of the night. I wish the ringing would stop, but even more than a week after the treated water was released, I was still receiving harassing phone calls from China, starting with the country code 86. Why are you making these calls? Bankisha called 40 numbers from the ramen shop's call history. Reporter Hello. Hello. The person on the other end of the phone call was a 28-year-old who lives in China's Yunnan province. Why did you call? Why are you complaining when the Chinese released 28 nuclear waste water into the sea? Make some food with nuclear waste water Why are you calling a place you have no business with? The release was probably because all 28 Chinese and Japanese citizens agreed.I was able to hear about 15 cases. Some of them said they were 16-year-old high school students. By making phone calls, you are causing inconvenience to businesses that are open. What do you think about that? Chinese high school student 16 I don't understand. Did your friend give you his number and ask you to call him? Chinese high school student 16 Yes, how many people did it? Is there a trend in schools with 162 or 3 Chinese high school students? Chinese high school student 16 So-so, it's trendy. Is everyone doing it? Chinese high school student 16Yes, it's causing trouble, so please tell everyone to stop.Chinese high school student 16Although I understand, the ramen shop also left an unexpected message on the answering machine. It was a voice in Japanese. Voice left on answering machine: I'm Chinese. I can not speak Japanese. sorry. Many irrational people made nuisance calls. You shouldn't. I would like to apologize on behalf of them.The message was to apologize for the nuisance phone call from China. We need to be aware that not all Chinese ramen shop owners make nuisance calls.Even when we conducted interviews in China, we were met with calm voices. Beijing Citizen Nuisance Calls Are Not a Fundamental Solution Beijing Citizen I don't think it will be of any use for individuals to make phone calls when the Chinese government can't stop them from being released. This is the Japanese government's responsibility, not the Japanese people's.The Ministry of the Environment released the results of its second sea area monitoring regarding treated water on the 1st. This time as well, the concentration of tritium was below detectable levels. However, there continues to be opposition to the release of treated water. I think it will affect the fate of Beijing citizens and humanity. We shouldn't do this.People in Beijing are surprised and outraged that Japan released nuclear wastewater.I also spoke to Chinese tourists visiting Japan. A Chinese tourist from Shanghai: I'm worried, so I might be cautious about eating food from Fukushima.Would I eat food from other regions? Chinese tourists from Shanghai eat. A mother who came to Japan for the first time with her 5-year-old child. Since Japan is a developed country, I think they are handling the Chinese tourists from Nanning properly. I don't think it will harm the people of my country by purposely releasing bad things into my country.While in Japan, he plans to go eat sushi with his children.

"The Japanese economy used to have a strong presence in the world, but recently its decline has often been pointed out. Economic analyst Takuro Morinaga interprets the hot new book, Kodansha Gendai Shinsho, written by the NHK Special Reporting Team on the Middle Class Crisis. It is certain that Japan's GDP will be overtaken by Germany and fall to fourth place in the world. The biggest reason for this is probably the downfall of office workers. According to the book, the median income distribution for all households has decreased from 5.05 million yen in 1994 to 3.74 million yen in 2019. Not only has the middle class declined, but household disposable income has decreased by 20% over the past 30 years due to increased burdens of taxes and social insurance premiums. As a result, the Japanese people, who were once considered to be middle class, have come to regard the majority as being below the middle class. Why did something like this happen? This book explores the causes mainly through on-site interviews. The bottom line is that human capital has been lost. Due to restructuring, companies lost engineers and the number of non-regular employees increased significantly, resulting in an increase in the number of workers who lacked the necessary skills to begin with. Therefore, this book emphasizes the importance of reskilling for the future revival of the Japanese economy. The key to Shigeki Makido is for workers to relearn and acquire skills such as digital technology. Indeed, if you look at international comparisons of human capital investment, you will find that Japan has extremely little investment. However, this does not mean that Japanese companies have not invested in human resources. Unlike in Europe and the United States, companies have carried out thorough on-the-job training within their companies. In the first place, without accumulating technology, Japan could not have achieved rapid economic growth and become the world's number one manufacturing powerhouse. After all, the real cause of Japan's economic decline may be that companies no longer value their employees. In that sense, I think it is wonderful that the book concludes with an example from the Netherlands. The Netherlands is a country with stronger worker protection than Japan. Restructuring and wage cuts are strictly restricted. Even so, the company boasts high productivity because there is no discrimination between regular and non-regular employees, whether in terms of hourly wages or the social insurance system. Therefore, I feel that by changing the economic and social system to one that puts workers at the center rather than companies' convenience, the serious and resourceful Japanese people will once again be able to regain the highest level of technology in the world.

"On NHK's discussion program on the 26th, ruling and opposition party officials discussed the issue of non-recording of party ticket income for political funds by each faction of the Liberal Democratic Party in political fund income and expenditure reports. Katsuya Okada, secretary-general of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, called for an investigation to be conducted to ensure that not only political groups but also corporate purchases are omitted, and the results to be made public. The omission of each faction was revealed by comparing the reports of each faction and political groups. However, this method does not reveal the amount of purchases made by companies that do not submit reports, and some believe that the uncovered omissions are just the tip of the iceberg. Mr. Okada pointed out that you should be able to tell by looking at the bankbooks of each faction. There are also suspicions that total income may have been under-reported. He said that unless the representative of each faction or the general secretary said that they had checked it themselves and found there were no problems, he would not be able to trust it. Tomomi Inada, acting secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party, asked for understanding that they will carefully examine the political organization section and provide corrections and explanations if necessary. I hope that Komeito's acting secretary-general, Hisashi Inatsu, will thoroughly investigate and analyze this matter and provide an explanation. We request that you respond promptly. Fumitake Fujita, secretary-general of the Nippon Ishin no Kai, emphasized that he wants the Liberal Democratic Party to take full accountability for whether it was a mistake or intentional. The Communist Party's General Secretary Akira Koike is suspected of being affiliated with the Liberal Democratic Party. He points out that donations to corporate organizations, including political parties, should be prohibited. Makoto Hamaguchi, acting chairman of the Democratic Party of Japan's Policy Research Council, should straighten out his situation. He said it was not enough to simply correct the report.ã€€"
